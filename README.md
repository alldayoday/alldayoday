About Erin üçÄ

I am a full stack developer with a background in logistics focused on creating user-friendly applications with reusable and adaptable code. I think strategically and functionally to plan and execute applications. I am passionate about building things from the bottom up, and tailoring web applications to fit more than their original intended use. I‚Äôm looking for an opportunity to learn and grow within a company that can provide avenues of improvement for my knowledge base.
